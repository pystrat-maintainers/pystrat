Convenient stratigraphic plotting and analysis in Python.

*pystrat* seeks to make the plotting and analysis of stratigraphic data reproducible and simple.

## Installation

### PyPI

To install the latest release from PyPI, simply enter the following at the command prompt:

```
pip install pystrat
```

### GitHub

To install the latest version of the code directly from GitHub:

1. Open Terminal.

2. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.

```
cd <path/to/directory/>
```

3. Copy, paste, and execute the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/yuempark/pystrat.git
```

4. Set the path by opening `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` (usually in your root directory) and adding the following:

```
export PATH=$PATH:<path/to/directory>/pystrat
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<path/to/directory>/pystrat
```

* If you don't want to mess with your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc`, just make sure that your code is in the same directory as `pystrat-tutorial.ipynb`.

## Usage

A tutorial on how to use the main features of *pystrat* are included in [tutorial.ipynb](docs/tutorial.ipynb). Illustrations of the available swatches that can be implemented using the `style.csv` are provided in [swatches.md](swatches.md).
